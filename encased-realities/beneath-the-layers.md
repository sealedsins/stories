# Beneath the Layers

The itching began when I was six. It crept up my arms and legs, spread across my back, and settled there, relentless and unforgiving. Doctors called it atopic dermatitis, a fancy term for what felt like my skin betraying me at every turn. 

It flared up in patches — angry, red, and unbearably itchy — and no amount of lotion or cream ever seemed to soothe it for long. My mom tried everything: oatmeal baths, prescription ointments, dietary changes. 

Nothing worked.

By the time I was a teenager, I had learned to live with the stares and whispered comments. I hid under long sleeves and pants, even on the hottest summer days. At school, I avoided gym class and dreaded pool parties, knowing how my skin would look if anyone saw it. 

My body had become a source of shame, a battleground of irritation and insecurity.

When I turned eighteen, I found myself wandering through an odd little shop downtown. It was the kind of place I wouldn’t normally step into — dimly lit, with a faint smell of rubber and leather. But a pair of shiny black gloves caught my eye. They were simple, elegant, and oddly mesmerising. Something about the smooth surface called to me, promising a kind of escape I couldn’t quite put into words.

I bought them on a whim, tucking the bag under my arm and hurrying home before I could change my mind. Once in my room, I slid the gloves on carefully, one finger at a time. The material was smooth and cool against my skin, wrapping around it like a second layer. For the first time in years, my hands didn’t itch. They didn’t dry out. 

They felt... completely normal.

At first, I only wore them at home, when I was alone. I didn’t want to explain to anyone why I was wearing them, or risk the inevitable teasing. But the relief they brought was undeniable. Over time, I started experimenting — wearing them out for short trips, hiding them under long sleeves or pretending they were just a quirky fashion statement. No one seemed to notice or care.

The gloves were a gateway. When the itching on my arms and legs became unbearable, I found myself searching online for something more. That’s when I discovered latex clothing. For me it wasn’t just a kinky fashion trend — it was as necessity. 

The smooth material acted as a barrier, protecting my skin from the harsh outside world and locking the moisture inside. I started small, with a pair of leggings, then a long-sleeved top. Each piece felt like a revelation, a protective shell against the relentless war my skin waged on itself.

Before I knew it, I was wearing latex every day. Under my clothes, it became my secret armour. No one had to know that beneath my jeans and sweaters was a sleek, glossy layer keeping my skin safe. The itching subsided, the flare-ups became less frequent, and for the first time in my life, I felt in control.

Of course, living with latex as a second skin wasn’t without challenges. 

Summers were tricky, and I had to learn how to care for the material properly — washing, polishing, and storing it to keep it from degrading. Dating was another story. How do you explain to someone that you wear latex not for fun or kinky sensations, but because your own skin won’t cooperate? I kept it hidden, wearing ordinary clothes on the surface and hoping no one would ever notice what was underneath.

By the time I reached my mid-twenties, my wardrobe was carefully curated to accommodate my precious rubber garments. I owned several pieces in different styles, all in muted colours to seamlessly blend in.

Now, at twenty-eight, I’ve come to terms with my secret. The latex has become part of who I am, a strange but necessary extension of my own body. It shields me from pain, both physical and emotional, allowing me to exist without constant discomfort or judgment. It’s not a cure, but it’s enough.

My mornings begin the same way every day. I wake up to the soft hum of my alarm and stretch, feeling the snug embrace of my latex sleepwear. It's slightly looser than my daytime clothing, but still fit close enough to keep my skin calm through the night. I push back the covers, the sheets gliding easily against the latex surface, and swing my legs over the side of the bed. With a deep breath, I step onto the cool floor and head straight to the bathroom, where the day’s routine begins.

A lukewarm shower comes first — never too hot, as that would only provoke my skin. The water cascades over me, washing away the lingering heaviness of sleep. Afterward, I pat myself dry with a soft towel, paying special attention to the areas that tend to flare up. Then I apply my moisturiser, a thick, unscented cream made for sensitive skin. I cover every inch, working patiently to ensure it’s fully absorbed. Only then does the latex truly do its job, sealing in that precious moisture that keeps my skin calm throughout the day.

Once my skin is prepped, I retrieve a fresh suit from my closet. Usually, it’s a beige catsuit with attached socks. The natural tone seamlessly blends in under the ordinary clothes, making it harder to notice underneath. The chlorination makes it easy to slide on even without lubrication, the smooth surface gliding effortlessly over my freshly moisturised skin. 

I tug it up carefully, ensuring the fit is perfect, and adjust the high collar around my neck. The suit hugs me like a second skin, snug and protective, shielding me from the harsh world outside. I run my hands over it, smoothing out any air pockets, and feel a sense of calm settle over me. 

Before leaving the bathroom, I put on a pair of matching beige gloves. They are thinner than the suit but just as essential, keeping my hands safe as I go about my day. At home, this is my standard uniform: suit and gloves. It’s a constant reminder of the boundaries I’ve set between my skin and the outside world, though their neutral tone helps me feel a little more normal.

In the kitchen, I prepare my usual breakfast — oatmeal with a drizzle of honey and a side of herbal tea. Cooking in gloves took some getting used to, but it’s second nature now. I wipe down the counters as I go, the latex squeaking softly against the surfaces. Cleanliness is non-negotiable; any dirt or dust can irritate my skin, even with the suit on.

Before stepping out for the day, I slip on a simple pair of jeans, a soft sweater, and sturdy boots. The neutral tones of my latex suit remain hidden beneath, invisible to the casual observer. A quick check in the mirror reassures me that no seams or unusual sheens are showing. Satisfied, I grab my bag and head out.

Today’s plan includes a trip to the grocery store. I prefer shopping early in the morning, before the crowds gather. The grocery store is a mix of comfort and challenge—it’s routine but also a place where I’m hyper-aware of my movements and interactions.

As I navigate the aisles, I make sure my gloves are hidden beneath the sleeves of my sweater. I reach for a bundle of kale, the cool texture of the gloves gliding against the crinkled leaves. The barrier is a constant reminder of the silent battle my skin wages every day. I linger in the fresh produce section, selecting apples, a box of strawberries, and a few lemons. The squeak of the latex as I grip each item is faint but unmistakable to me.

By the time I reach the frozen aisle, I’ve settled into the rhythm of the store. I retrieve a bag of frozen peas, their chill momentarily refreshing against the tight rubber. A few other shoppers pass by, focused on their own errands, paying me no mind. That anonymity is a relief, a rare moment of peace in a world that often feels too exposed.

At checkout, I make polite conversation with the cashier, who comments on the strawberries I’ve chosen. “They look perfect for this season,” she says with a warm smile. I return her smile, feeling a quiet satisfaction that my secret remains intact.

With the groceries loaded into my car, I make a quick stop at a boutique downtown. Shopping for clothing has become a careful ritual, balancing aesthetics with practicality. The shopkeeper greets me with familiarity, her eyes lighting up as I browse. I pick out a loose, linen tunic and a pair of relaxed-fit trousers, both ideal for layering over my suits. The texture of the linen complements the smoothness of the latex, providing a perfect balance of comfort and concealment.

After paying, I tuck the bag into the backseat of my car and head home. Once inside, I unpack the groceries, methodically wiping each item with a damp cloth before placing it in the fridge or pantry. The sound of latex against plastic echoes softly in the quiet kitchen, a small but constant reassurance that I’m taking care of myself.

By mid-afternoon, I settle at my desk for work. Remote work is a blessing, allowing me to avoid the stares and questions that come with venturing outside too often. My colleagues know me as diligent and efficient, though none of them know about my condition. It’s my little secret, hidden beneath the professional persona I project through email and video calls.

During the online meetings, I position the camera carefully to show only my face. My gloves and suit remain out of view, blending seamlessly into the backdrop of my daily routine. If anyone comments on how "smooth" my hands or neck look in passing, I just gently smile and change the subject. 

It’s easier that way.

As the daily meeting winds down, I jot down the last of my notes and switch off the camera, grateful for the buffer of the screen. Remote work offers a unique kind of invisibility, one that allows me to be seen only on my terms. I glance down at my hands, the faint matte sheen of the latex catching the light from my desk lamp. It’s a small, grounding moment before I dive back into my spreadsheets.

By late afternoon, I take a break, stepping outside to water the plants on my small balcony. The sun filters through the leaves of a potted fern, casting dappled shadows on the concrete. The suit keeps the breeze from brushing my skin directly, but I don’t mind. I’ve grown to appreciate the sensory trade-offs—less vulnerability in exchange for a layer of calm. I gently tilt the watering can, watching droplets soak into the soil, and take a deep breath.

Evenings are my sanctuary. After dinner, I settle onto the couch with a book or a quiet movie. Today, it’s a novel about a character escaping to the countryside, a topic that resonates with my own need for peace and privacy. My fingers glide over the pages, latex smoothing out the texture of the paper. The world outside feels far away, the hum of the day fading into stillness.

Occasionally, my mind drifts to the people who’ve come and gone in my life — friends who didn’t understand, dates that fizzled out when my condition became too complicated to explain. It used to hurt, the rejection, the judgment. Now, I see it differently. The people who stay are the ones who don’t need every answer, who accept me as I am, even if they only see the surface.

Before bed, I repeat my nightly ritual: a lukewarm shower, a generous layer of moisturiser, and the careful donning of my familiar night outfit. It fits snugly but not too tightly, providing just enough comfort to let me drift off.

On rare occasions, like tonight, I add one final piece: a mask. 

It is meant to cover my head entirely, leaving only small openings for my eyes, mouth and nostrils. I don’t wear it too often — not because it’s uncomfortable, but because it feels like crossing a line. It’s the final barrier, a layer that separates me completely from the outside world. But tonight, I need it.

I hold it in my hands for a moment, the smooth rubber piece pliant between my fingers. Then, slowly, I lift it to my face, sliding it into place. The snug fit is comforting, a strange but familiar sensation of being completely enclosed, shielded from everything. My breathing adjusts to the faint resistance of the material, soft and rhythmic, like a lullaby only I can hear.

As I lie down, the mask amplifies the quiet around me. Every sound — the rustle of the sheets, the faint hum of the night outside — feels distant, muted. My thoughts, usually a tangle of worries and reflections, begin to still. Wrapped in this cocoon, I am untouchable. 

Safe.

Tonight, my mind drifts not to the people who’ve come and gone, but to the version of myself I used to be: the child who cried at night, the teenager who hid under layers of fabric, the young adult who avoided mirrors. I think about how far I’ve come — not just in finding ways to live with my condition, but in learning to accept the person it has shaped me into.

I’ve spent years thinking of my unusual garments as armour, as a way to keep the world out. But they’ve also become something more. They’re a part of me now — not just a barrier, but a bridge. They allow me to engage with the world on my terms, to step outside without fear of judgment or pain. They’ve given me back something I thought I’d lost forever...

Control.

As my breathing slows and sleep begins to take me, I imagine what tomorrow might bring. Maybe I’ll work up the courage to tell someone about my condition — not everyone, just one person who matters. Or maybe I’ll keep it to myself, letting the world see only what I choose to show. 

Either way, I know I’ll be okay.
