# Liquid Dreams

The mid-morning sun beamed down on the crystal-clear waters of the community pool. The scent of chlorine mingled with the cheerful chatter of kids splashing and parents lounging on deck chairs. Among them was me, clutching an unassuming duffle bag and nervously glancing around. 

Inside the bag lay my prize — something resembling a wetsuit, yet far more peculiar. It was a full-body, glossy rubber suit inspired by the iconic look of a vaporeon, one of my favourite pokémon. The most prominent part of it was the attached hood, featuring a playful muzzle with large eyes and a cute pointy snout.

A week ago, when I impulsively ordered it, I thought it was the coolest thing ever. Now, standing poolside, I wasn’t so sure. Would it be too much? Would people stare? Would the kids think it was lame?

I took a deep breath and made my way to the changing rooms. If you are going to do something like this, you need to commit.

The changing room was quiet, save for the muffled echoes of splashes outside. I carefully unzipped the bag and pulled the suit out. It looked even more impressive now than the first time I saw it online, stirring a quiet surge of anticipation within me.

"Okay," I whispered, "no turning back now."

Step one was the tail. I picked up a small valve located near the tail's base and began inflating it with measured breaths. Slowly but surely, the tail filled out, its curved shape perfect for swishing in the water. I gave it a gentle pat, a subtle smile curling my lips as a sense of excitement took root.

Next came the suit itself. I slid my feet into the sleek, glossy material, feeling the rubber stretch snugly around my ankles. Initially cool and slightly slippery against my skin, it began to warm quickly as I pulled it higher and higher. I wiggled slightly to slide it over my hips, smoothing out the few creases that formed along my thighs.

The torso section required a bit more effort. I carefully fed my arms through the sleeves, marveling at the way the material tapered seamlessly into webbed gloves. The rubber stretched tightly across my chest and stomach, moulding to my body's contours without being too restrictive. 

Finally, I picked the mask hanging on the suit's collar. It looked even more detailed up close — gleaming blue rubber, with large, tinted glass lenses in place of the eyes. Inside, I noticed a snorkel-like mouthpiece built into the mask's interior. I held the mask for a moment, hesitatingly testing it with my fingers.

Inhaling deeply, I brought the mask up to my face, pressing it firmly against my face. The smooth rubber hugged my cheeks as I started easing it over my head. The mouthpiece settled into place, and as I bit down lightly, it moulded comfortably to my teeth, allowing me to breathe through my mouth easily.

With the mask now comfortably in place, I reached for the zipper.

Finding the tab at the very top of my head, I began to pull it down with steady determination. The rubber tightened and sealed around my neck, shoulders, and back as the zipper glided smoothly, stopping just at the base of my spine.

I paused for a moment, savoring the snug embrace of the suit as it fully enveloped me. The tinted lenses bathed the room in a gentle blue glow, transforming my surroundings into a serene, otherworldly space. A wave of calm assurance washed over me.

Fully dressed, I turned to the mirror and let out a delighted sigh. The reflection staring back at me was no longer just me — it was a living, lifelike vaporeon.

It brought back memories of receiving a Pokémon Diamond cartridge for my Nintendo DS, a treasured birthday gift from my older brother. Those countless afternoons spent exploring the Sinnoh region had ignited a lifelong passion for these fantastical creatures, extending far beyond the games themselves.

"Vaporeon, I choose you!" I exclaimed softly, feeling a surge of excitement and determination.

Stepping out onto the pool deck was a mix of nerves and excitement. The suit squeaked faintly as I walked, the tail swishing naturally behind me. I caught a few curious glances, but to my relief, most were smiles or intrigued looks. A group of kids immediately ran over, their eyes wide with fascination.

"Whoa! Are you a Pokémon?" one boy asked, his enthusiasm evident.

"That's so cool!" a girl exclaimed. "Do you swim like a vaporeon too?"

I laughed, my voice softened by the mouthpiece. "Only one way to find out!"

I stepped up to the edge of the pool, my webbed fingers flexing instinctively, the fins on my back catching the light. With a deep breath, I dove in.

---

The moment I hit the water, it felt like diving into a liquid dreamscape. The suit seemed to shimmer with a life of its own, dancing around me as I moved. I floated in a bubble of cool, weightless comfort, the water gliding over the glossy surface of the rubber like liquid glass. There was a quiet joy in the effortless glide, a harmony I hadn't anticipated.

As I stretched my arms forward, the suit responded with a playful ripple, sending sparkles of light cascading around me. My legs kicked out, and the tail behind me swayed in a rhythmic, fluid motion, propelling me through the pool with the grace of a mythical sea creature. Each stroke felt natural, a seamless extension of my own movements.

Underwater, the tinted lenses softened the light, turning the shimmering surface into a dazzling kaleidoscope of blues. Bubbles danced upwards like tiny, iridescent fairies, adding to the surreal ambiance. The gentle resistance of the water mirrored a subtle balance I had found within myself.

My tail curved and twisted, almost as if it had a mind of its own, creating intricate patterns in the water. The webbed gloves amplified each stroke, allowing me to glide smoothly through this submerged wonderland. I couldn’t help but grin beneath the mask — this felt like a pure aquatic bliss, a moment of effortless joy and confidence.

For a delightful moment, I forgot I was just a girl in a rubber suit. I was a graceful vaporeon, sleek and swift, born for this very element.  A subtle warmth and assurance settled within me, mirroring the harmony I felt in this newfound form.

---

The kids cheered as I surfaced, water streaming off the shiny rubber. I flicked the tail playfully, sending a small spray their way.

"Vaporeon used Splash!" I announced dramatically, earning laughter and applause.

By the end of the day, any lingering doubts had melted away. The suit, once a source of uncertainty, now felt like a second skin, making me reluctant to part with it.

As the sun began to set, painting the sky with hues of orange and pink, the pool area started to empty out. The laughter of the kids and the warm chatter of the parents faded into a pleasant background hum. I lounged on a deck chair, the suit still surprisingly comfortable, feeling a quiet sense of accomplishment.

A gentle breeze rustled the nearby palm leaves, adding to the serene atmosphere. I stretched out, my webbed feet playfully kicking the air as I gazed at the horizon. The suit's glossy exterior caught the last rays of sunlight, making me sparkle like a mythical sea sprite.

A couple of parents approached, smiling and snapping photos. My muffled voice bubbled through the mask as I joked, "Maybe tomorrow I'll host a Pokémon pool party!" I suggested enthusiastically, embracing my new, shiny identity.

We laughed together, enjoying the beautiful end of a fun day. 

As the last of the visitors gathered their belongings and the pool area quieted down, I remained on my deck chair, the suit still shimmering under the fading light. The gentle hum of crickets began to replace the daytime sounds, and the sky shifted to a velvety indigo as dusk settled in.

I took a deep breath, feeling the cool evening air flow through my lungs. Slowly, I stood up, the tail swaying gracefully behind me. The world around me had emptied, leaving a tranquil stillness that was both comforting and profound. 

With a final glance around to ensure I was truly alone, I walked toward the edge of the pool, the water reflecting the now fully dark sky dotted with countless stars.

Sitting on the edge, I allowed my legs to dangle into the cool water and lifted my head, peering at the vast expanse above. The stars seemed closer, their brilliance magnified through the lustrous glass. The constellations I had always admired now felt intimately close, as if I could reach out and touch the stars.

A peaceful silence enveloped me, and a warm sense of satisfaction settled in my heart. I took a deep breath, feeling truly connected to the moment.

"Best purchase ever," I whispered, smiling as I gazed up at the stars above.
