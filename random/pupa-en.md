# Pupa

Alina quietly closed the dorm room door behind her and, with a look of desperate determination, picked up her spacious sports bag from the floor. Something rustled inside. She froze, listening to the silence of the corridor, as if fearing someone might come out and ask where she was going at such a late hour.

She quickly fixed her slightly disheveled hair and slipped out of the building, attuned to the sound of her own heels clicking. It was a cool autumn evening outside. Alina zipped up her jacket a bit higher, trying to calm herself — partly from the chill and partly from anxiety.

Deep down, she knew she was treading on a slippery path - but her scholarship barely covered rent and food, and her part-time job at the university earned her only a pittance.

"How far I've fallen..." she whispered, opening the taxi app.

Seeing the fare, Alina nervously bit her lip. The amount on the screen seemed unaffordable for her tight budget.

"Maybe I should take the bus instead?" she thought aloud, glancing at her watch. But the last bus had long since left, and walking at this hour didn't seem like a good idea.

She recalled the promo code she had diligently saved for a rainy day. With an annoyed grunt, she entered the code into the app. The fare significantly dropped.

"I hope it was worth it..." Alina muttered discontentedly as she pressed the order confirmation button.

Within minutes, a car pulled up to the dorm courtyard. She settled into the worn backseat, trying not to draw unnecessary attention. The driver didn't even glance back, seemingly long accustomed to silent passengers who simply stared out the window, waiting for their destination.

Alina stole a glance at her phone: there wasn't much time left before the party began. A message from the club administrator had popped up, reminding her of the arrival time and the strict dress code.

"I just hope everything goes smoothly..." she whispered, watching the city lights flash by outside the window.

--- 

The club was housed in an old building tucked away in an unremarkable alley in the city center. Alina couldn't imagine that such parties were held in a place like this: high brick walls covered in moss and a heavy wrought-iron gate looked more like the entrance to a museum than a nightclub.

The driver stopped at the gate and, without saying a word, silently stared at his phone. Alina paid, got out of the car, and felt her legs shake more than before. It was now or never, she thought, pushing the gate towards the door with an unassuming sign.

Inside, she met the administrator—a pleasant middle-aged woman with jet-black hair and a gentle smile.

"Good evening, you're Alina?" she asked, tilting her head slightly.

"Yes, that's me..." Alina's voice sounded uncertain as if she couldn't believe it was all happening in real life.

"Great, come with me," the woman encouraged with a reassuring smile.

The administrator led her down a long, dimly lit corridor to a small dressing room.

"Alina, this is our dressing room. Once you're done here, head to the bar—someone will tell you what to do next," the administrator said calmly, though her voice carried encouraging undertones. "And don't worry, everything will be okay."

"Thank you..." Alina's voice was quieter than she had intended.

The dressing room was a small space with a few metal lockers, a full-length mirror, and a narrow couch along one wall. The bright lamp's light bounced off the white walls, giving the room the appearance of a modest backstage area.

Her bag thudded heavily onto the floor, and in the ensuing silence, Alina felt a familiar tinge of nervousness on her tongue. It was as if she could sense invisible eyes that had permeated these walls — almost physically feeling how thousands of uncertain people had changed here before her.

"Alright... let's begin," she exhaled, trying to muster her courage.

She took several deep breaths, attempting to calm herself. Her stomach fluttered uncomfortably, and her heart pounded relentlessly, reminding her that time was running out.

Without wasting any more time, Alina unzipped her jacket, carefully hanging it on a hook by the door. Underneath her thin turtleneck, she felt a chill — not just from the coolness, but from the realization that she was about to don an unusual, even provocative outfit.

She pulled a bulky package from her bag, containing her uniform — a flesh-toned latex suit with bright red accents. A quiet squeak and the faint smell of latex filled the tiny room as Alina unfolded the costume on the couch. Touching the smooth surface with her hand, she felt a slight coolness of the material and couldn't help but imagine how it would cling to her vulnerable body.

"God..." she whispered. "How did I ever agree to this?"

After removing her shoes and quickly discarding her turtleneck and jeans, Alina froze in indecision. An inner voice insisted there was no turning back. She took a deep breath, and then in one swift motion, she pulled off her underwear and tossed it to the edge of the couch. Her bare butt felt a slight chill, and her exposed body seemed to protest the touch of the air.

Ignoring the awkwardness that arose, Alina took a bottle of polish from her bag and, squeezing a bit of liquid into her palm, began carefully spreading it over her pale skin. With smooth motions, she rubbed it into her hands, shoulders, and legs, gradually covering her entire body with a thin layer of silicone lubricant. Her touches were almost hypnotic—a ritual meant to instill calm.

As her lubricated palms slid over her pale body, she unexpectedly felt a mix of curiosity and... excitement. Her fear began to blend with a slight thrill—partly from the novelty of the sensations and partly because she had never allowed herself such boldness before.

"God, what's happening to me?" a thought flickered through her mind.

Alina momentarily closed her eyes, listening to the sound of her own breathing. Inside, a tumultuous mix of emotions raged — fear, confusion, curiosity. A stubborn inner voice urged her to keep going. Just a couple more deep breaths, and she cautiously grabbed the edge of the latex fabric, lifting the suit in front of her as if fearing it might burn her hands.

It consisted of bright red stockings, long gloves of the same color, and a flesh-toned bodysuit with neatly outlined nipples. Completing the look was a pinkish mask with drawn-on eyes and a sensual mouth—her appearance seemed to have stepped right out of an adult fantasy. All of it was fused into a single suit, the only entry being a long zipper glued into the back.

"This has gone too far..." the girl muttered softly.

Carefully, trying not to damage the delicate latex with her long nails, Alina began pulling the suit onto her legs like a pair of tights. The sensation of the cool, slightly sticky smoothness was initially unpleasant, but after a few minutes, the material warmed from her skin's contact.

Gradually lifting the suit higher, she felt the latex snugly envelop her calves, sliding slightly along the inner thighs, absorbing the warmth of her skin and smoothing around every curve. The material's folds slowly disappeared, giving way to a smooth, flawless surface.

Reaching her waist, the girl paused for a moment, catching her breath and looking at her reflection in the mirror. The latex clung tightly to her hips, accentuating every curve and giving her body a doll-like smoothness. Alina ran her hand over the material, feeling her palm glide over the elastic surface.

"Oh my God," she murmured. The latex fit was much tighter than any clothing she'd worn before, pleasantly highlighting her slim figure.

Wasting no time, Alina continued the process, carefully pushing herself into the main part of the suit. The latex resisted, sticking to her skin, and the polish proved to be her only ally—the material gradually slid, yielding to her smooth movements.


The gloves were the most challenging part of the outfit. The girl squeezed out a bit more polish, lubricating her wrist, and carefully inserted her right hand into the sleeve of the suit. The latex protested, but soon fully enveloped her palm. When her other hand followed, she involuntarily flinched—the moment her hands were "locked" in latex felt like turning a key in her mind: there was truly no turning back now.

Stretching her arm behind her, she felt the zipper pull and began to pull it upward. The suit molded to every curve of her body, hugging her tightly while simultaneously constraining each of her breaths.

"Ugh..." she sighed loudly as the zipper reached the top of her back. "Almost done."

Her gaze fell on the mask that sagged languidly on the suit's neckline. Its smooth, shiny surface reflected the bright lamp light, almost enticing her. Alina traced the zipper that ended at her crown with her fingers, mentally picturing her head inside.

"It's just a job, Alina, just a job," she whispered.

Gathering her hair into a tight bun, she closed her eyes and carefully pulled the rubber doll face over her head. Gently adjusting the tiny eye holes, she felt for the zipper pull again and smoothly slid it upward, sealing the last gap between herself and the outside world.

Her breathing grew louder, and the sounds from outside were slightly muffled. In the mirror stood a figure with drawn-on eyes and red lips, almost cartoonishly erotic.

"Well, now there's definitely no turning back now," she whispered, trying to quell her trembling.

Alina froze in front of the mirror, feeling a growing sense of almost painful excitement—a mix of horror, embarrassment, and quiet delight at realizing she was capable of this. Her reflection seemed detached and lifeless, yet inside, everything was boiling.

"Just the final touch," she muttered after an awkward pause.

Taking a deep breath, she pulled a blonde wig from her bag and deftly placed it over the mask. Its soft, perfectly styled curls complemented the bright features of her drawn face—quickly transforming the absurd image of a bald mannequin into an almost doll-like beauty.

Quickly gathering her everyday clothes, Alina placed her bag in a locker and checked to ensure she had locked the door behind her. Her legs trembled as she left the dressing room and walked down the corridor back to the entrance. Under the thick layer of latex, she was already beginning to feel the first drops of sweat, and her nervous anxiety heightening every cell in her body.

"How do I look?" Alina asked the administrator quietly, slightly swaying on her heels.

"You fit our theme perfectly," the woman replied evenly. "Head to the bar counter; they're already waiting for you."

The girl nodded and took a cautious breath, trying to stay steady despite the tight feeling in her chest. Walking through the softly lit hall, she noticed that everything inside was decorated in the style of an old living room: dark furniture, heavy curtains, candleholders on the tables. Soft music only enhanced the intimate atmosphere.

The light subtly reflected off the surface of her second skin, giving her an unnatural, almost surreal appearance. She modestly approached the bar counter, where a few staff members in identical outfits were already stationed. She couldn't see their faces, making it hard to tell if they were as nervous as she was.

At that moment, the back door swung open, and another staff member entered. Her outfit starkly contrasted with the closed-off attire of the waitresses — a black and white latex bartender suit that emphasized her figure, and her confident stride suggested she had been working here for a while.

"Hi," she greeted Alina, her voice melodic and assured. "I'm Sophia, I'm on bar duty today. If you need anything, don't hesitate."

Alina awkwardly nodded, trying to hide her internal anxiety. She felt the tension gradually give way to curiosity and a slight excitement. Alina had experience working as a waitress before — but this was the first time she had to work in such an unusual outfit.

She carefully took a silvery tray from the bar counter and took her first step into a world that had been unfamiliar to her. A step filled with excitement, apprehension, and at the same time, quiet hope—deep down, Alina believed that this unexpected and extremely strange job might help her escape her financial abyss, even if just a little.

For now, all she could do was focus on her duties and try to forget how provocative her reflection looked, fleetingly visible in the glass reflections.

--- 

The first hour of her shift passed in a haze for Alina. She carried drinks, weaving between tables, trying not to think about her own appearance. Gradually, the hall filled with guests, most of whom were dressed in various fetish outfits, perfectly fitting the party's theme.

One such visitor was a large man, fully clad in a black suit that left no inch of skin exposed. The shiny latex surface reflected the soft spotlight, giving him an almost alien appearance. His face was hidden behind a smooth mask without any cutouts, and only small breathing holes hinted at a person beneath.

Next to him walked a neat, petite girl in an elegant, deep purple latex dress. Her long dark hair was pulled into a high ponytail, revealing a slender neck adorned with a delicate silver necklace. In her right hand, she held a thin leash connected to a collar around her companion's neck. Their interaction looked natural and harmonious as if they were one entity.

Alina couldn't help but admire the couple, noting to herself how naturally they seemed together. She felt her own anxiety gradually subside, giving way to curiosity and even a slight excitement from the happenings around her.

"How's it going? Getting used to it?" Sophia asked softly, noticing Alina's gaze on the couple.

"Yeah, I guess" Alina admitted. "It's just... so unusual here."

"Yeah, it always takes a while to get used to," Sophia smiled, following her gaze. "But I see you're handling it pretty well. If you need anything, don't hesitate."

Alina nodded and, taking another order, headed to the far corner of the hall. The music shifted to a more relaxed tune, and the lighting became even dimmer, creating an intimate atmosphere. She noticed that some guests had started dancing.

With interest, Alina watched the fluid movements of the dancers, feeling herself begin to relax to the music's rhythm. There was an extraordinary sense of liberation around her: guests laughed, exchanged glances, and touched each other without any unnecessary shyness.

Returning to the bar, Alina felt the tension gradually ease. The work was flowing smoothly, and she was finding it easier. She even began to notice previously overlooked details of the club's interior: old paintings on the walls, elegant chandeliers, and soft sofas that created a sense of luxury and comfort.

When it was time for a short break, Alina sat on a chair in a corner near the bar counter. Sophia placed a glass of water in front of her.

"You're picking up the pace quickly," Sophia praised. "Newbies usually tremble with fear and avoid the guests. But you're already bustling around with the tray!"

"Oh, thanks..." Alina took a small sip of water through a thin straw. "I'm still on edge, but I'm trying to pretend everything's okay."

"You're doing great. The main thing is not to be afraid, then you can earn well here and even have some fun."
She watched Sophia skillfully mix cocktails, interacting with guests and colleagues. Her movements were confident and graceful as if she had long been a part of this world. But what amazed Alina most was how easily Sophia recognized her among the other waitresses, all dressed in identical suits and hidden behind identical masks.

Gathering her courage, Alina decided to ask the question that had been nagging her all evening.

"Hey... can I ask you something?" Alina hesitated, glancing at the other waitresses in matching outfits. "How do you even recognize me? We all look almost identical here."

Sophia chuckled softly, her laughter gentle and encouraging.

"You have very expressive eyes," Sophia replied with a sly smile. "And your walk is, well, pretty distinctive. I always pay attention to those details."

Alina blinked, confused as she tried to process what she'd heard.

"Eyes?" she asked. "But can you see anything through those slits?"

Sophia nodded.

"More than you think. Even if your face is covered, your gaze can tell a lot about a person. Plus, the way you move, your gestures—they're unique to each of us."

Alina pondered this. She had never considered herself special, often shying away from excessive attention. Yet here, in this strange place where everyone was dressed alike, she found herself easily recognizable.

"Honestly, I... haven't really thought about it much," she admitted.

"Sometimes masks don't hide us; instead, they help show what we usually conceal," Sophia observed, watching Alina intently. "Today, you overcame yourself, and it shows."

Alina felt her cheeks flush beneath the mask. She looked away, gazing at her hand covered in red latex.
Sophia placed a hand on her shoulder.

"Don't worry. In time, you'll get used to it. Just remember - masks are just part of the game. The main thing is to stay true to yourself."

Alina felt warmth from her touch and an unexpected wave of something indescribable.

"Thank you. That's... very kind."

"No need to thank me. If you have questions or just want to talk—feel free to reach out anytime," Sophia said, removing her hand and adding lightly, "Now, back to the guests, or they'll get bored without our attention."

Alina nodded and, taking the tray, began working with renewed energy. She aimed to execute orders flawlessly, be attentive to the guests, and remember to smile—even though her smile was hidden by the mask. Gradually, she started to feel like part of the scene, and the discomfort almost entirely vanished.

"Sophia, how did you end up working here?" she asked, waiting for her next order.

Sophia looked up, her gaze slightly thoughtful.

"Oh, that's a long story. But to put it briefly, I've always liked the atmosphere of places like this. Here, people can be themselves, express what they usually hide in everyday life. And I just enjoy helping them do that by setting the mood."

"Sounds interesting. I think I understand what you mean," Alina replied quietly, recalling her own feelings that evening.

"You didn't just end up here by chance, did you?"

Alina shrugged.

"Probably. At first, it was a forced decision, but now... I'm starting to get the hang of it."

Sophia smiled.

"I'm glad to hear that. If you feel like it, you can try other roles too. I think you have great potential."
"We'll see," Alina responded shyly.

Receiving another tray of drinks, she returned to the guests.

Time flew by unnoticed, and soon the visitors began to disperse. When the last guests left the hall, Alina let out a sigh of relief and placed the tray on the bar counter. Her shift was coming to an end, and a sense of fatigue slowly crept into every fiber of her being. Sophia, having finished tallying the earnings, approached her with a warm smile.

"Phew, what a night!" Sophia sighed in relief and turned to Alina. "You did great today, handled everything perfectly."

"Thank you," Alina replied softly, feeling a light fatigue mix with the satisfaction of a successful shift. 

"Honestly, I'm still a bit wired. But I'm glad I didn't mess up."

"Absolutely. Everything went excellently," Sophia nodded approvingly. "Now, you can go change. And by the way, don't forget to collect your payment from the administrator at the exit."

"Of course, thanks," Alina replied and headed toward the dressing room.

Inside, the familiar setting greeted her: metal lockers, a full-length mirror, a couch, and a few high stools. The soft tap of her footsteps echoed off the white walls, highlighting her solitude after a busy shift.

Removing the wig and carefully setting it aside, Alina touched her rubber face. For a moment, she paused, listening to her sensations. This evening had been a challenging test, but she had managed — and even derived a strange, twisted pleasure from it.

With a slight effort, she pulled the zipper down and, carefully grabbing the edges of the mask, slid it off her face. Cool air touched her sweaty forehead, and Alina took a deep breath, enjoying the sensation.

"That's it," the girl said wearily.

But suddenly, Alina hesitated: in this old club, there probably wasn't even a proper shower, and walking home drenched in sweat didn't seem like a very appealing idea.

"Oh, whatever," Alina thought. "I'll tough it out until I get home."

Pulling on her jeans and turtleneck directly over the shiny latex, she carefully packed all her things into her bag, took the envelope with her payment, and stepped outside.

There, on the porch, was Sophia, dressed in a tailored trench coat. Her short hair was loose, and in the soft glow of the streetlights, she looked even more attractive.

"Alina, wait," Sophia called out to her.

"Yes?"

"I wanted to thank you once again for the great work today. I hope we meet again."

"Thank you, Sophia. I enjoyed it too. I'd be happy to come back."

Sophia smiled.

"I'm sure you're a great fit for us. By the way, if you'd like, I can give you a ride home."

Something warmed inside Alina. She caught herself smiling back much wider than the situation warranted.

"I woudn't mind," she replied softly.

They headed together to the parking lot, where Sophia's car—a nondescript silvery sedan—was parked. The night air was even cooler, and Alina pulled her jacket tighter, feeling the smooth surface of the latex beneath the fabric. Sophia opened the passenger door and gestured for Alina to get in.

"Thank you," Alina smiled as she took a seat and buckled her seatbelt.

Sophia walked around the car and settled behind the wheel. As soon as the engine purred softly, a subtle jazz melody filled the cabin, creating a cozy atmosphere.

"Where to?" Sophia asked, looking at Alina.

"To the university, I live in the dorm," Alina replied, awkwardly smiling. "I hope it's not too out of your way."

"No, not at all—it's right on the way," Sophia shrugged and started driving.

They drove in silence for a while, admiring the night city lights. Alina glanced over at Sophia—she looked relaxed and confident, her hands firmly on the wheel, her eyes reflecting the occasional glare of oncoming headlights.

Alina felt fatigue wash over her again after the long day, but something else also bothered her. The latex suit under her clothes was beginning to cool, reminding her of the thin layer of sweat beneath it. She shifted in her car seat, feeling a slight discomfort.

"You know," Sophia suddenly said with a warm smile, "the red color suits you very well."

Alina froze, not immediately understanding what she was talking about.

"Uh... what?" she asked, looking down at her hands.

To her horror, she noticed a bright red edge of her latex glove peeking out from under her jacket sleeve.

"Oh, I..." Alina quickly pulled up her sleeve, hiding the glove. "Sorry, that probably looks weird."

Sophia laughed softly.

"No problem," she said. "I sometimes forget to remove something after work too. You get used to the feeling and don't want to part with it."

Alina felt her ears burn from embarrassment — whether from the hint of flirtation in Sophia's words or from feeling foolish herself.

"I just thought I was sweating a lot, and there's no shower in the dressing room," she explained, trying not to look at Sophia.

"I completely understand," Sophia nodded. "I've been saying for a long time that we need a proper bathroom, but who's interested..."

She paused, then added with a light smile:

"But I have to admit, there's something special about you."

Alina raised her eyebrows in surprise.

"Something special?"

"Yes," Sophia confirmed, giving her a brief glance. "Usually, newbies rush to get rid of their outfits right after their shift—but not you."

"Don't you think that's strange?" Alina asked, slightly embarrassed.

"Not at all," Sophia smiled. "On the contrary, it just shows that you're starting to embrace this new part of yourself."

Alina pondered her words.

"You know," Sophia continued, "things like this tend to liberate people. They help reveal what's usually hidden deep inside."

"Maybe you're right," Alina replied quietly. "Today, I felt... different. Like I could be myself without fearing judgment."

Sophia nodded approvingly.

"Remember what I said about your eyes? They reflect so much more than you think."

Alina gave a modest smile.

"Thank you, Sophia. You're probably the first person who's seen me... from this side."

Sophia smiled again and focused on the road. The car glided smoothly through the night streets, and an easy silence settled between them. A few minutes later, they arrived at the dormitory where Alina lived. 

"Here we are," Sophia said, slowing down at the entrance.

Alina unbuckled her seatbelt and turned to Sophia.

"Thanks again for the ride," she sincerely thanked her. "And... for tonight too."

Sophia gave a gentle nod.

"It's nothing," Sophia waved her hand. "Glad to help."

Alina gathered her remaining resolve and quietly said:

"Hey..." Alina grabbed the door handle and glanced at Sophia discreetly. "Maybe we could meet up outside of work sometime? Maybe grab a coffee..."

"I'd love that," Sophia replied without a hint of hesitation.

After thanking Sophia, Alina exited the car and watched her for a few more seconds until she disappeared around the corner. The night's coolness enveloped her tired body, and Alina finally turned toward the dormitory building. Quietly entering, she walked down the dark corridor, listening to the soft squeak of latex beneath her clothes.

The room greeted her with silence. Alina closed the door behind her, tossed her bag aside, and leaned her damp back against the wall for a moment. She remembered Sophia's gaze, the inexplicable warmth, and the slight tremor inside her. For the first time in a long while, the girl felt like her life had, even if just a little, started moving forward.

"Well, time to return to the gray everyday life," she quietly told herself.

Alina quickly shed her clothes and ran barefoot across the cold floor to the closet. Taking out a clean towel and a soft robe, she headed toward the small bathroom she usually shared with her roommate.

"It's good she went to stay with relatives. There would have been endless questions..." she thought, closing the bathroom door behind her.

She approached the mirror and looked at her reflection. Her striking face was framed by messy chestnut hair, slightly damp from sweat. Her eyes shone with slight fatigue, but they reflected satisfaction and a faint smile she couldn't hide.

"It was worth the risk," Alina muttered and slowly ran her hand over the squeaky surface of the suit.

Stepping into the shower stall and turning on the faucet, she let the warm stream of water envelop her body. Steam filled the small room, hiding the outlines of her figure behind a light mist.

After standing for a few minutes, the girl reached for the zipper on the back of the suit. Her slippery, water-soaked fingers found the pull, and with a slight effort, she lowered it, feeling warm water begin to seep inside.

Alina slowly started to remove the suit, feeling it resist with effort, almost unwillingly peeling off her body. The warm water eased the process, and gradually, Alina freed herself from the tight embrace of the latex. Finally, the suit fell to the bottom of the shower cabin with a soft splash, forming a shiny pile at her feet.

She picked it up and thoroughly rinsed it under the stream, washing away the remnants of polish and sweat. The smooth surface gleamed again, reflecting the light from the yellow bulb above the mirror. Alina carefully wrung out the suit, trying not to damage the delicate material, and hung it on the curtain rod to dry until morning.

After washing up and turning off the water, the girl wrapped herself in a soft towel, feeling the pleasant warmth and comfort after a long day. She approached the mirror, watching droplets of condensation slide down the glass, slightly blurring her reflection. Her damp hair lay on her shoulders in dark strands, and her eyes shimmered with quiet serenity.

Alina quickly dried her hair with a hairdryer, combing it and restoring its usual neat appearance. Putting on her favorite home robe, she felt a comforting warmth spread through her body, reminding her of the eventful evening.

She returned to her room, where the gentle dawn was already painting the sky with pink and orange hues. The girl glanced at her phone: a few notifications from classmates and a reminder about the upcoming exams. But her thoughts were filled with entirely different things.

Snuggled in her warm bed, Alina allowed herself to reminisce about the day. The image of Sophia reappeared in her mind: her warm smile, understanding gaze, and the unexpected interest that had awakened new, entirely unknown feelings in Alina.

"It's all so... unreal," she whispered into the emptiness of the room, closing her eyes.

Soft darkness enveloped her, bringing much-needed rest. Soon, her steady breathing filled the room, and Alina drifted into a deep, peaceful sleep.

_09.01.2025_
